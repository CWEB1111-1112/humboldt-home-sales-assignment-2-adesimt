#  Humboldt Home Sales Agent Performance Calculator

The Humboldt Home Sales Agent Performance Calculator is a program that allows you to track the total sales for their three agents (Silas, Noah and Chris). The program also provides you with a summary of who has the highest and lowest amount of sales.

## Requirements
Construct a program that prompts the user for a salesperson initial(S,N or C) Either uppercase or lowercase initials are valid. While the user does not type Z, continue by prompting for the amount of a sale. Issue an error message for any invalid initials entered. Keep a running total of the amounts sold by each salesperson. After the user types Z or z for an initial, display each salesperson's total, a grand total for all sales, and the name of the salesperson with the highest total.
